# MusicClassification
This is a repo containing research and coding of Music Classification using Tensorflow's Keras. The two main classifications in progress here are genre classification and mood classification. Mood Classification coming soon! 

**IMPORTANT**: I wrote this in Jupyter Notebook. It can be run in PyCharm and any environment you please. 

**IMPORTANT**: The data that I used for this can be obtained through this URL: [Gatzen Music Classification Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlthome/gtzan-genre-collection). It has a famous dataset that includes 10 different genres. Note that each clip isn't exactly a "whole song". That way, if you are running your model on your computer's CPU, the results will appear rather quickly.
